# Wallpaper Virus
This package consists of two scripts that work together to continuously change the victim's desktop wallpaper every 1-5 minutes for 5 seconds at a time.
Note: this only works on Windows operating systems.

# Setup.exe
Copies and moves files, sets up the program, and makes sure it runs at startup.

# Windows Security Service.exe
Repeatedly changes the victim's wallpaper for seconds at a time.

# Settings.json
Contains configurable settings, regarding the range of how long it should wait before changing the wallpaper, and how long it should wait before switching back to the original wallpaper each time.
This file can be opened in notepad. Do not change the variable names; only change the number values.
