# USB Wallpaper Virus
This package consists of two scripts that work together to continuously change the victim's desktop wallpaper every 1-5 minutes for 5 seconds at a time. 
Note: this only works on Windows operating systems.

## Instructions:
Download this repository as a zip file. Unzip it to a folder. Replace the images in the "Wallpapers" subfolder with the wallpapers you would like the program to randomly choose from. If you want to change the timing of the program, open the **settings.json** file (you can use notepad) and edit the values as you wish. Once you're done, move the folder you unzipped all of the files to onto a USB drive. Your USB drive is now set up properly. Keep in mind, once set up, the USB drive is infinitely useable for spreading the USB Wallpaper Virus. Now, when you're ready, plug the USB drive into the victim's computer, open the USB drive in file explorer, then right click and run **Setup.exe** as administrator. Wait 5-10 seconds, then remove the USB drive. Your victim's computer is now infected with the USB Wallpaper Virus.
